Originally from the Santa Cruz mountains, I currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I hold a B.A. in English from Scripps College and an M.A. in Interdisciplinary Computer Science from Mills College. I work as a software engineer specializing in frontend, web-based application development and when I'm not coding, I'm writing poetry and getting back into writing fiction. I also have professional experience working as a graduate computer science assistant, a teacher and mentor for girls and young women in STEM, and a curriculum developer for teen-appropriate computer science courses. In my free time, you can find me hanging from the ceiling in a circus gym, burying my nose in a book, and hollering about feminism. I'm a lifetime Californian, a beer and coffee enthusiast, and a crazy cat lady in the making.
